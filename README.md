## Traversy Media React Crash Course

Getting back into React

Using class components, no global state manager

State exists in the main App.js component, and is passed down as props

Functions to update state work the same way, they exist where state is managed, then are passed down to the component that needs to call it as a prop

Fixes / Additions:
Added ternary to style checkbox on load depending on completed
